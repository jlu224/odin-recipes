    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pastry dough for a deep dish pie crust</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped leeks</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>3 Large eggs</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>6 ounce Gruyère cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll pie dough to fit a (9-inch) deep-dish pie plate. Press into the pie plate and chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before baking. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Line chilled pie crust with foil and fill halfway with dried beans, rice, or baking weights. Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue to bake until golden brown, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>While the pie crust is baking, cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the pan to drain. Blot out some of the oil from the skillet, leaving 1 to 2 teaspoons. Add leeks, onion, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir until tender and golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Remove the pie crust from the oven. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Whisk eggs and egg yolks together with cream and milk in a large bowl. Add thyme and stir to combine. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle 2/3 of the leek mixture over the bottom of the baked crust. Top with 1/3 of the cooked bacon and 2/3 of the Gruyère. Carefully ladle in egg mixture, then sprinkle with remaining leek mixture, bacon, and Gruyère. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, set, and no longer jiggly in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving. </li>
    </ol>
